# The Chemistry::Elements Perl 6 module

The Perl 5 version of `Chemistry::Elements` was my first module, so
I'm making it my first Perl 6 module too. It's not complicated.

The module maps between element names (_e.g._ Rubidium), symbol
(_e.g._ Ru ), and number (_e.g._ 37). It's multi-language aware
although the language switching isn't sophisticated yet.
